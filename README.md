### Predicting-Churn-Users.ipynb
This notebook contains the code used for the entire exploratory analysis process and the ML model selection and tunning.

## Data

Every time the user interacts with the service it generates data that contains the key insights for keeping users happy and helping the business thrive.

## Modeling Process
For fitting the data, I tried a RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, and LogisticRegression. I prioritized the model that performed best at the f1 score since the dataset is imbalanced (Few Churned users).
The best model was a RandomForestClassifier tunned with various hyperparameters and features.
